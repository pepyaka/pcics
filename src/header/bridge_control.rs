//! Bridge Control Register
//!
//! The Bridge Control register provides extensions to the Command register that are specific to a
//! bridge. The Bridge Control register provides many of the same controls for the secondary
//! interface that are provided by the Command register for the primary interface. There are some
//! bits that affect the operation of both interfaces of the bridge.
